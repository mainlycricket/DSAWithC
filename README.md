I've prepared this repository while studying `Data Structures with C`. I've implemented the most common data structures and sorting algorithms. I've used the double pointers approach in LinkedList and BST. I'll keep adding more content. Feedbacks are appreciated!

Some of the resouces I've used are:

- [`MyCodeSchool`](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2_aWCzGMAwI3W_JlcBbtYTwiQSsOTa6P): I can't overstate the quality of content on this channel. My mind was blown away when I came across the concept of pointers to functions and callbacks (yes, in C!) in this [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2_aWCzGMAwLZp6LMUKI3cc7pgGsasm2_).

- [`Neso Academy`](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBlnK6fEyqRj9lld8sWIUNwlKfdUoPd1Y): Neso Academy is a popular channel for Computer Science tutorials. The 'C' tutorials playlist is quite superb!

- [`Data Structures Through C`](https://in.bpbonline.com/products/data-structure-through-c-3nd-edition-book-ebook) by Yashwant Kanetkar. I was so impressed by the `Let Us C` book that I decided to buy this book. I'd say this is a decent book, if you are a habitual book reader.
